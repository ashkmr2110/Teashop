                    In India, chai is more than just a cup of tea to start the day – the thick sweet
                    drink is an integral part of the rhythm of life. Everything,
                    from neighbourly gossip to intense political discussions happens over
                    a cup of tea. One of the oldest drinks in history,
                    chai is also India’s most popular drink – the
                    country consumes a whopping 837,000 tonnes of tea every year!

                    A legend says that it was a king in ancient India (most likely Harshavardhana,
                    under whose patronage Nalanda University reached its zenith)
                    who developed chai to remain alert during long court hour.
                    Some historians also believe that Emperor Ashoka too had made it a
                    part of his various peace treaties and court culture, a habit that eventually
                    percolated down to common people.

                    Over time, an exchange of customs and cultural ideas led to a
                    growing thirst for tea among all classes, not simply the wealthy.
                    Thanks to the British Raj, the concept of tea time also came into existence.
                    It is also worth noting that tea wasn’t an overnight success in India. Each region and
                    community in India took its own time to adopt and adapt tea to its own tastes. Today,
                    there are a billion possible ways in which this combination can be effected in India,
                    the most popular ones being Mumbai’s cutting chai, the rich Irani chai of Hyderabad,
                    the fragrant Darjeeling chai, the mellow Assam chai, the strong masala chai of Gujarat and the
                    delicate pink Kashmiri chai.
